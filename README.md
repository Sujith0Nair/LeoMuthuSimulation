# LeoMuthuSimulation
A tribute to the late MJF Lion Leo Muthu in VR which is exclusively made for Oculus go / Samsung gear

This project was developed in Unity3d to run the application in oculus/samsung gear vr one needs the pre-requisties: Unity3d, Android SDK with minimum API 21 and Oculus Utilities.

The application runs as a timed teleporter where user moves from one spot to another in a timed and controlled environment. Hence there is a lot of scope for development. The teleportation feature is included but not implemented. And Unsynchronous scene management can be handled with an intermediate loading screen. 

This project was developed by complete support of staff and HOD of CSE department of Sri Sairam College of Engineering.
